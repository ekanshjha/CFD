Currently, the finance sector is a major user of Blockchain and it is being implemented in other sectors, such as healthcare, smart contracts and personal identification. “Politics” is one institution where its application is highly anticipated and deserves close observation.

Of course, the first thought may be, “How could Blockchain possibly operate in the world of politics?” Surprisingly, Blockchain could have a Big-Bang effect on elections. It can transform the nature of our voting by providing a critical benefit we all want – “Security.”

The system of politics, be it in any corner of the world, has some leaky spaces and questionable ethics during many elections. Blockchain is needed the most to protect the integrity of elections in spite of increasingly improved security. The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)/ballot we use and trust to select our politicians is vulnerable to hacking, but Blockchain technology can deter anyone from meddling with our important right and responsibility as citizens.

Blockchain has already been put into practice in elections. The model that can be used to increase the voters count and security at top level can be:

A voter is given a “wallet” (a type of user identifier or credential) and a “coin” (an opportunity to cast a vote). The voter’s identity is then verified using biometric tools, such as a thumbprint scan, before voting on a mobile device. Verified voters would then be able to cast their votes electronically into a blockchain-based ledger, where their votes would remain secure and transparent while maintaining the anonymity of voters and results, which would be stored in various nodes. Each recorded vote then forms part of a chain of votes, where the third-party participant who has agreed to a specific set of guidelines about how transactions are processed within a blockchain, mathematically proves it. This third-party verification network is a group of independent verifying actors, such that no single person can alter any data in blockchain himself or herself. In short, the recorded votes will be remarkably secure.
